                <h2>Things <em>are</em> happening!</h2>
                <time datetime="2013-08-30">August 30th, 2013</time>
                <p>
                    Even though things may seem as if they've been standing still on this website, a lot has actually happened in the first few months of this company's hopefully long life. A lot of administrative details are falling into place, including talks with the bank and the setting up of a range of Google services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few things <em>have</em> happened on this website though. Just yesterday Smart Layers were added (from <a href="//www.addthis.com">AddThis</a>) and the footer has been cleaned up considerably.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, we're developing a smartphone application for Android and iOS for a danish company, <a href="//www.danmarksflyttemand.dk">Danmarks Flyttemand ApS</a>, which is almost done and ready for Android, while we're still waiting to hear from the Apple developer program enrollment after almost two weeks since we applied for enrollment. Patience is a virtue, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we're having meetings with potential future employees and partners, including an accountant and a story/lore writer for our upcoming game project, tentatively named 'Right to Rule'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're very excited and ambitious for the future of this company and feel that our game project has some real potential. Of course, it'll still be at least a couple of years before we're anywhere near an alpha stage of the game. All good comes to those who wait... is the hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, please follow us on social media and check in on our website regularly, as we will try to update it more often from now on.
